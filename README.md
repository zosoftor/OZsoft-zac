- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zac! I am a Data Engineer/Analyst working mostly on the MS flavor of things (except when it comes to data viz, I'm all Tableau there).  I am currently trying to turn myself into a true Full Stack Engineer.  I consider this someone with the ability to deliver ML?DL solution powered software via CI/CD cloud-hoosed web/mobile tech stacks.  That's my aim.
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in evolving my skill-set into that of a true Full Stack Engineer.  I am currently working on it in the Java/Spring and .NET worlds.  I also am capable of shipping software on the MERN stack but really the web tech stacks aren't the crux - I know those already - I'm really interested in getting into hybrid mobile dev and CI/CD to round out my strong Data Engineering/Web Dev knowledge.
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning MonoGame and Docker/Kubernetes.
