- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zac! I'm a Full Stack/Mobile Engineer (mostly employed doing Front-end/React or iOS) who started life as a systems programmer and have recently begun to move deeply into Machine Learning.  My skill-set includes: MAIN TECH : I call it the GERM stack: React/Redux on the front-end (with Next.js for SSR), MySQL handling the data layer and Go with its Echo framework handling server-side duties.  I try to use as much React Native as possible to handle my mobile needs but am fluent enough in iOS/Droid to ship software on those platforms.  PAST TECH: Used to work systems in C/C++ with some assembler.  BUILDING TOWARD: I'm getting into both competitive programming and machine learning so currently getting familiar with the numpy/pandas libraries and jupyter notebooks in all their glory!
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in web/mobile development gigs and learning new machine learning algorithms and libraries that will help me implement them efficiently.
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning progressive web apps, secure coding said apps, aforementioned assorted AI/ML stuff and how to participate in competitive coding - via Kaggle/Topcoder (though I'm really new in that arena and so don't know if I will stick with both/one/either of them or move to a different place.
