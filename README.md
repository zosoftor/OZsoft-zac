- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zac! Here you will find my personal projects/learning aides created as I learn various tech.  I will also be housing my proprietary 2D engine here once finished (it will be free for personal/commercial/whatever use).  I am a Data Analyst transitioning into API Engineering and those efforts are recorded here.  GLHF!
