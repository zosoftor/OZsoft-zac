- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zac! I am an AI Engineer (DS/DL/ML...I like it all) who is also a gamedev junkie!  I began life as a systems programmer and pretty much all of my professional work has been in C/C++/SQL(MS/Oracle mostly but it really doesn't matter), and as I moved into the different AI fields I took up Python to work with the various tools and libraries powered by the language that are relevant to those areas.  
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in end-to-end AI development and game development.  I also dabble in competitive programming/ML via Kaggle and Topcoder.  As far as what the whole end-to-end thing means to me, I describe that as having the capability of developing an ML powered application and wrapping/deploying it in a web, mobile, or desktop package - necessitating full-stack web/mobile dev knowledge.  As far as that applied to my gamedev hobby, it means I start with openGL/SDL and program my own game, use a paint tool like Photoshop/Aseprite to do my art and FL Studio for all my sound needs. 
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning SDL and 2d game engine architecture.
