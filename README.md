- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Zac! Here you will find records of my learning journey (via small apps and coding exercise solutions) through programming and the software I am building/have built.  I am a programmer of many different stripes by day and an aspiring independent video game developer by night/weekend! I will be producing my games in my own engine as they are 2D and I just don't really want to pay Unity or Epic for the privilege of releasing my work!!  My engine will be made free and open to the public for personal/commercial/whatever use as soon as it is finished.
- 
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in building software that is fun to use, runs really well, and does really gnarly stuff for folks!
- 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use Nez with MonoGame and how to produce high-resolution pixel art.
- 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can just shoot me a message on here if you'd like to talk!
